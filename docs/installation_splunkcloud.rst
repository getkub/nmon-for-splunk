Deploy to Splunk Cloud
======================

**Deploying Nmon Performance Monitor in Splunk Cloud**

Nmon Performance Monitor is entirely compatible with a Splunk Cloud deployment, offering 100% of app functionality.

The Nmon core application will be deployed to Splunk Cloud

Optionally, you can use Nmon Performance to monitor the Splunk Cloud instance itself (the same you would with a single Splunk instance)
The TA-nmon App will be deployed to your servers and will send performance data to Splunk Cloud transparently

Step 1: Deploy Nmon Core Application to Splunk Cloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install Nmon Core App
"""""""""""""""""""""

Once connected to your Splunk Cloud instance, go to the Application menu management:

.. image:: img/install_splunkcloud1.png
   :alt: install_splunkcloud1.png
   :align: center

Search for the Nmon App and confirm installation:

.. image:: img/install_splunkcloud2.png
   :alt: install_splunkcloud2.png
   :align: center

Finally, Nmon Performance Monitor is installed:

.. image:: img/install_splunkcloud3.png
   :alt: install_splunkcloud3.png
   :align: center

Step 2: Deploy TA-nmon to your Universal Forwarders agents to send Performance data to your Splunk Cloud instance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configure Forwarding to Splunk Cloud
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you haven't already, open the Universal Forwarder Application and follow instructions to install and configure your Universal Forwarder instances to send data to Splunk Cloud:

**Open the Universal Forwarder App:**

.. image:: img/install_splunkcloud6.png
   :alt: install_splunkcloud6.png
   :align: center

**Follow instructions and install Splunk Credentials:**

.. image:: img/install_splunkcloud7.png
   :alt: install_splunkcloud7.png
   :align: center

*If this is your first Universal Forwarder deployment to Splunk Cloud, you can easily validate your installation by confirming the Universal Forwarders sends data to Splunk Cloud:*

**Search Splunk internal events:**

::

    index=_internal

**As exposed above, you should see incoming events from your host, example:**

.. image:: img/install_splunkcloud8.png
   :alt: install_splunkcloud8.png
   :align: center

Deploying the TA-nmon
"""""""""""""""""""""

**Finally deploy the TA-nmon to your Universal Forwarder instance(s):**

* Upload the TA-nmon package to your servers

* Install the TA-nmon:

**Manually:**

The TA-nmon is a tar.gz archive located in the "resources" of the core Application.

It must be uncompressed and installed in the indexer in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/deployment-apps/ (where $SPLUNK_HOME refers to the root directory of Splunk installation)

::

    cd /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/apps

    tar -xvzf /tmp/TA-nmon_*.tar.gz

And Restart the Universal Forwarder.

**Using Splunk CLI:**

You can install the TA-nmon using Splunk CLI:

::

    /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk install app /tmp/TA-nmon_*.tar.gz -auth admin:changeme

Restart the Universal Forwarder

**Example:**

::

    [root@RHEL7 ~]# /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk install app /media/BIGDATA/TA-nmon_V1.2.27.tar.gz -auth admin:changeme
    App '/media/BIGDATA/TA-nmon_V1.2.27.tar.gz' installed
    You need to restart the Splunk Server (splunkd) for your changes to take effect.

    [root@RHEL7 ~]# /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk restart
    Stopping splunkd...
    Shutting down.  Please wait, as this may take a few minutes.
                                                               [  OK  ]
    Stopping splunk helpers...
                                                               [  OK  ]
    Done.

    Splunk> The Notorious B.I.G. D.A.T.A.

    Checking prerequisites...
        Checking mgmt port [8089]: open
        Checking conf files for problems...
        Done
    All preliminary checks passed.

    Starting splunk server daemon (splunkd)...
    Done
                                                               [  OK  ]
    [root@RHEL7 ~]#

Step 3: Check your work and verify incoming Performance events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A few minutes later you will immediately start to receive incoming Performance data from your servers:

.. image:: img/install_splunkcloud9.png
   :alt: install_splunkcloud9.png
   :align: center

And you will find incoming data from your host(s):

.. image:: img/install_splunkcloud10.png
   :alt: install_splunkcloud10.png
   :align: center

Recommended: After you added new hosts to your deployment, you can immediately update configuration information by running the dedicated report (this is operation is done by default every hour):

.. image:: img/install_splunkcloud11.png
   :alt: install_splunkcloud11.png
   :align: center

Et voil√† !!! There you go, enjoy :-)
