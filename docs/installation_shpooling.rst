Deployment on Search Heads running in SH Pooling mode
=====================================================

**Using Search Head in Search Head Pooling is now deprecated and has been advantageously replaced by Search Head Clusters.**

I would definitively recommend using sh Clusters in replacement, sh pooling has serious limitations compared to powerful SH Clusters.

Therefore, Nmon Performance Monitor can totally run in search heads running in SH Pooling with absolutely no trouble.

Installation is covered in details in the distributed deployment guide: :ref:`distributed_deployment_guide`

* See the detailed section: :ref:`deploy_sh`
