Deployment topologies
=====================

------------------------
Splunk native deployment
------------------------

**There are multiple ways to deploy and use the Nmon for Splunk App, the first thing you need to remember is that the App can globally operate in 2 different modes, as follows:**

* Real Time: Nmon raw data is read while the nmon file is on process (the nmon instance that holds the file is currently running and periodically updating it)

* Cold Mode: The Application is being used to manage collection of nmon raw files generated out of Splunk (nmon instances have terminated and files are closed)

These deployment scenarios are detailed in the deployment section, as in an introduction, here are some deployment scenarios.

**Real time deployment scenarios:**

This is an example of deployment for standard scenario with multiple *nix clients running the addon "TA-nmon", managed trough a deployment server, indexing Nmon data into a Splunk indexer cluser running the addon "PA-nmon", exploiting Nmon data in a Search Head cluster running the core "nmon" application

This is an example of deployment for standard scenario with multiple *nix clients running the addon "TA-nmon" and sending data to intermediate Heavy Forwarders, all managed trough a deployment server, indexing Nmon data into a Splunk indexer cluser running the addon "PA-nmon", exploiting Nmon data in a Search Head cluster running the core "nmon" application

**Cold data deployment scenario:**

This is an example of deployment for standard scenario with a single Heavy Forwarder Splunk instance running the addon "TA-nmon", indexing Nmon data from central NFS repositories into a Splunk indexer cluser running the addon "PA-nmon", exploiting Nmon data in a Search Head cluster running the core "nmon" application

-----------------
Syslog deployment
-----------------

**Additionally and since the version 1.6.14, it is possible to use Syslog as the transport layer associated with a third party package called "nmon-logger"**

This deployment topology offers 100% of application functionality without any deployment of Universal Forwarders on end servers, using rsyslog or syslog-ng.
Such a deployment will for example answers to people that cannot or don't want to install any third party agent.

Such deployment will use and require and/or recommended:

* nmon-logger

* rsyslog or syslog-ng

* cron

* logrotate

Note that this deployment scenario will be recommended mostly with modern Linux deployment scenarios.
Although all pieces of software should work fine too on AIX and Solaris, this requires quite up to date versions (for rsyslog / syslog-ng), which could be complex on older OS.

**Example 1: Splunk Universal or Heavy forwarder installed on main syslog-ng collectors:**

**Example 2: Splunk Universal or Heavy forwarder installed third party servers running syslog-ng:**
