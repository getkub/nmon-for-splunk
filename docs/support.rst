Community support with Splunk Answers
-------------------------------------

One great way to have support is asking the community, Splunk has a strong community of active users and Splunk Answers is an important source of information.

You can directly look for users messages related to the Application:

http://answers.splunk.com/answers/app/1753

I will myself receive notifications for any new App related message, and will answer to them in better delays, this also provides information for any people encountering same needs in the future.

--------------------
Google Group Support
--------------------

An App dedicated Google Group has been created:

https://groups.google.com/d/forum/nmon-splunk-app

This is also a great source of support from people using the Application, and you can also (if you subscribe to mailing news) receive important notifications about the App evolution, such as main release announcements.
